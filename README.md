# TRIS APP REACT

Hi 🖐️, Tris App React ("Tris" is the Italian name for the game Tic Tac Toe.)

Beginner developers may find in this code an example of usage of:

- spread operator (...).
- ternary operator
- template expression
- functional state update
- short-circuit evaluation


That's all, have a good day 😉

# A little help for beginners:

```sh
cd tris-app-main
npm install
npm run dev
```
